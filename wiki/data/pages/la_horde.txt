====== La Horde ======

//« In the Dark God’s frozen claws, scores will be settled in blood. //

//Only one will survive to lead them all. Even the greatest amongst them, those that have called the claws their home from before the age of man, will bow to this one. //

//The one will raise the banners of war, and like vermin, they will come in their hordes from the bowels of the earth, and the coldest wood shall burn and the fortresses shall become as dust. »//
