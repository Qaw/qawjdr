//« A sea will form in the Caraheen, a vast sea of fire. It will stretch as far as the eyes can see. From the east, a great beast of metal will come, lumbering over the bones of the earth. It shall feed the sea like none other, belching fire and devastation. Even death will not be a refuge, as the dark spirit of this fire will allow no rest and no end to torment. »//
